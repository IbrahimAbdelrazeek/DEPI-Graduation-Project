DEPI-Graduation-Project 
- is a comprehensive security-focused tool and research initiative aimed at enhancing web application security. This project comprises two key components:

1. A Subdomain Enumeration Tool:
Built using Go, this tool efficiently identifies subdomains associated with a target domain. It is designed for speed, scalability, and ease of integration into larger security workflows, making it an essential resource for reconnaissance in penetration testing.

2. Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis:
As part of the project's research component, we conducted an in-depth penetration test on a web application, uncovering and documenting the most common web vulnerabilities. These include, but are not limited to:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
SQL Injection
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Security Misconfigurations
Broken Authentication

Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to provide tools and insights that help developers, security enthusiasts, and organizations identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities effectively. By combining automated enumeration techniques with manual penetration testing, DEPI offers a practical approach to strengthening web security.

Key Features
Go-Based Subdomain Enumeration Tool:
Fast and efficient enumeration.
Handles large-scale domain queries.
User-friendly interface and customizable options.
Common Vulnerability Report:
Detailed documentation of attack vectors and their impacts.
Practical recommendations for mitigation.
Evidence-based examples to demonstrate exploitation techniques.


- GoHack  is more than just a tool; it's a learning resource and a practical solution for web application security. Whether you're a security researcher, developer, or a student, this project serves as a stepping stone toward understanding and implementing secure web practices.
